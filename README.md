# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Internship Task to predict Titanic passenger survival using logistic regression.
Certainly, here's a more detailed README.md file for your Titanic Survival Prediction project on GitHub:

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project for predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. We use the Titanic dataset, a well-known dataset in the data science community, to build a predictive model. The primary objective is to determine the likelihood of a passenger surviving or not during the tragic Titanic disaster based on various passenger attributes.

## Dataset Description

The Titanic dataset is well-documented and includes the following columns:

- **PassengerId**: A unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Survived**: Target variable (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived).
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).
- **Name**: Passenger's name.
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: Age of the passenger.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number.
- **Embarked**: Port where the passenger boarded (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Md-Awaf/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the Titanic dataset (CSV file) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset) and place it in the project directory.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, build the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for analysis. The following preprocessing steps are performed:

- Handling missing values, including imputing missing ages and embarked locations.
- Encoding categorical variables, such as gender and embarked location, into numerical format.
- Feature engineering to create new features, such as "FamilySize" by combining "SibSp" and "Parch."
- Removing unnecessary columns like "PassengerId," "Name," "Ticket," "Cabin," and "Fare."

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential phase to gain insights into the dataset. The following visualizations and analyses are conducted:

- Distribution of survival to understand the class imbalance.
- Age distribution to observe the age demographics of passengers.
- Survival by passenger class to identify class-based survival trends.
- Survival by gender to explore gender-based survival trends.
- A correlation heatmap to assess feature relationships.

## Model Building

A logistic regression model is constructed to predict passenger survival. Logistic regression is chosen for its simplicity and interpretability, making it a suitable starting point for this binary classification problem. However, alternative machine learning algorithms could be explored for comparison.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is assessed using various metrics, including:

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: The ability of the model to correctly identify positive cases.
- **Recall**: The ability of the model to capture all positive cases.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Classification Report**: A comprehensive report displaying precision, recall, and F1-Score for each class (Survived and Not Survived).
